- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#45B69C) to highlight interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary, geometric style.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a touch of warmth.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for navigation and actions. Keep the style consistent across the app.
- Implement a fully responsive, grid-based layout to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Employ the principles of glassmorphism by using semi-transparent panels with a subtle frosted glass effect to create depth and visual interest, but keep glassmorphism use minimal in order to maximize readability and minimize distracting visual clutter.
